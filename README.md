# hex_value
`hex_value` is a crate defining a type designed to represent a hexadecimal value, preserving the 
input value's width.  `HexValue` may be used wherever hexadecimal representation is required.

One use is as a host machine's typed representation of a memory address on a remote machine,
such as a flash memory base address on a connected embedded device.
